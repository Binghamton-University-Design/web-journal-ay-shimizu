					<h2>Project 3: Article Illustrations (3/3)</h2>
					<p><img src="images/macos_review.png"></p>
					<p> For this article illustration project, we chose three different online articles and we created illustrations relating to the articles. This project focuses on creating illustrations with similar styles and using a variety of media. I chose to use combine vector art using illustrator and rasterized art using photoshop.

					<h2> <a href="posts/icons.html">Project 2:  Scalable Icons</a></h2>
					<p><img src="images/icons_set_BW.png"></p>
					<p><img src="images/icons_set_color.png"></p>
					<p> For this scalable icon project, we had to create three icons that represent different aspects of ourselves.These icons must be designed to fit together with similiar aestheics and be scalable in three sizes: 128px, 64px, and 32px.My three icons depict one of my hobbies, a culutural aspect, and an academic aspect of myself. For my hobby, I chose baking, so I decided to create an icon of a cupcake. As a cultural aspect, I chose to create a bowl of rice because rice is a staple to Japanese cuisine. As an academic aspect, I chose to create an icon of a laptop because as a Computer Science major and a Graphic Design minor, I use my laptop very often.

					<h2> <a href="posts/avatar.html">Project 1: Isometric Avatar</a></h2>
					<p><img src="images/avatar_web.png" title="Avatar"></p>
					<p>Isometric drawing is a style to create 3D drawings on a 2D surface using 30-degree angles. For our first project, we created isometric icons of ourselves using Adobe Illustrator. In my icon, the glasses are an essential part of my appearance since my eyesight is quite awful, and I rarely wear contacts anymore. Another aspect of myself that I added to the icon is my phone. I often read webtoons (digital comics) on my phone as a pastime and as a good break from schoolwork.
