					<p>
            For this project, we chose three different online articles and we created illustrations relating to the articles. This project focuses on creating illustrations with similar styles and using a variety of media. I chose to use combine vector art using Illustrator and rasterized art using photoshop.
					</p>

          <p>
            I searched the Apple News for recent news articles and chose articles that were different. I ended up choosing articles about psychology, climate/environment, and technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first article I chose was called <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happens-in-your-brain-when-you-zone-out-according-to-experts-18759418" target="_blank">“What Happens In Your Brain When You Zone Out, According To Experts” </a> by Carolyn Steber. This article explains how zoning out is a natural response to stress. So, for my illustration, I drew a girl spacing out in class, and I drew her in Illustrator as vectorized art. Then I used photoshop to draw the girl stressed and overwhelmed with a lot of work. But the hecticness is paused, which illustrates why the girl is zoning out.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second article I chose was called <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/10/how-antarctic-melting-above-below-ice-sheet/" target="_blank">” How Antarctica is Melting From Above and Below” </a> from National Geographic. This article explains that glaciers/ice shelves are melting due to increased heat from above, but the increasing amount of warm waters are also contributing to the melting. So, I drew glaciers as vectors and I portrayed the warm waters as hands trying to grab the glaciers drawn with photoshop.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third article was called <a href="http://wired.com/story/macos-1015-catalina-review" target="_blank">"Review: MacOS 10.15 Catalina"</a> from wired.com. This article informs readers about the new updates for MacOS. My concept for this illustration was a magician-like person presenting all the new updates. I played around with the blur effect on Illustrator here.
            <br>
            My third illustration was definitely rushed. The floating icons could be more uniform and incorporated into the illustration rather than being plopped on top.

          </p>

          <p>
            All three illustrations are similar in the way that it is obvious that vectorized and rasterized art are being used. My idea was that the vectorized art represents the “reality”, the and the rasterized art the “comic-y” and fantasy aspect. For example, the reality in my first illustration is the girl zoning out in class, but in her mind, her hectic brain is on pause. In the second illustration, the glaciers are the reality and the hands as water as well as the faces on the glaciers are the comic-y aspects that add to the illustration. In the third illustration, the reality is that Apple has all these new updates, and the fantasy part of it is that Apple is being portrayed as a person.

          <p>
            <a href="../images/article_layouts.pdf" target="_blank" > This is a pdf file </a> where the illustrations are added to an article template just to see what they would look like if they were used in an article.
